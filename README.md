# Simple DNS-watchdog script for RouterOS

This simple script switch DNS-server for DHCP-leases to internal router IP when external server not responding

This script use comments in config for pick vars (that I don't like, but it works)

Checked on RouterOS 7

*Script was written for my parents, who have an AdGuard DNS server on small MiniPC, that can be switched off accidentally*
